# Cryptopals Challenges in Rust

This repository contains solutions to the Cryptopals cryptography challenges, implemented in Rust. The Cryptopals challenges are a series of practical cryptography exercises designed to teach and test your understanding of cryptographic concepts and secure coding practices.

## Structure

- Each set of challenges is organized into its own module or directory.
- Solutions are written in idiomatic Rust, with a focus on safety and clarity.
- Where appropriate, tests are included to verify correctness.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securecodeauditing-cryptopals-rust.git
    cd securecodeauditing-cryptopals-rust
    ```

2. **Build the project:**
    ```sh
    cargo build
    ```

3. **Run tests:**
    ```sh
    cargo test
    ```

## Prerequisites
